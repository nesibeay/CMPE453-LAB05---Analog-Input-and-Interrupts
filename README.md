# CMPE453-LAB05---Analog-Input-and-Interrupts

Program	the	microcontroller	by	using	C	programming	on	Arduino	IDE.	When	
your	program	runs,	it	should	do	the	following	task.

I. Define	a	threshold	for	light	sensor.	When	the	day	light	is	above	the	threshold	
the	LED	should	be	turned	on.	Otherwise	it	should	be	OFF.

II.When	the	button	is	pressed,	an	interrupt	is	sent	to	AVR	which	makes	the	buzzer	
rings	for	4	seconds.	As	button	is	released	or	not,	the	microcontroller	will	
continue	doing	(I)	after	delay
